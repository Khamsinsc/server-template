# ToDos

1. __Fork__ this repo to your account then __clone__ it to your folder  - OR  - just __download as a zip__, and it comes without any `.git` folder, so it doesnt messes up your existing folder.
2. run `npm install`
    * check if nodemon have been installed as well, if not, install it manually
3. Set your database credentials in the `.env` file and add `.env` to the `.gitignore` - now your database should work just fine
4. Feel free to check out the _snippets_ folder for additional code snippets.
5. Bear in mind, that this is a mere spine of a server, you have to give it functionality.
